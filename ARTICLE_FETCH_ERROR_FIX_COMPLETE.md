# Article System Fetch Error Fix - Summary Report

## Problem Analysis
The "Failed to fetch" error when synchronizing article content between the database and frontend sections was caused by several issues:

### 1. **URL Configuration Inconsistencies**
- `ArticleService` was using `https://localhost:5001` (HTTPS with invalid certificate)
- Debug page was using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` with `http://localhost:5000`
- Environment variables were not consistently configured

### 2. **Backend Server Not Running**
- The .NET backend server was not actively running on the expected ports
- Database seeding was incomplete, lacking sample articles for testing

### 3. **CORS Configuration**
- While CORS was properly configured in the backend, the HTTPS certificate issue prevented proper connection

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ **1. Fixed URL Configuration**
- Updated `ArticleService.ts` to use `http://localhost:5000` instead of `https://localhost:5001`
- Updated `events.tsx` to use consistent API URL
- Confirmed `.env.local` has proper environment variables:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
  BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
  ```

### ✅ **2. Enhanced Database Seeding**
- Added comprehensive sample articles to `DbInitializer.cs`
- Added English articles specifically for frontend sections:
  - "Modern Yoga Practice: A Beginner's Guide"
  - "Calisthenics: Building Strength with Bodyweight"
  - "Strength Training Fundamentals for Beginners"
- Articles are properly configured with:
  - Published status: `true`
  - Featured status: `true`
  - Appropriate tags for search functionality
  - SEO metadata

### ✅ **3. Backend Server Configuration**
- Verified backend runs on both HTTP (5000) and HTTPS (5001) ports
- CORS properly configured for frontend origins
- ArticleService properly registered in DI container

### ✅ **4. Testing Infrastructure**
- Created `article-system-test.html` for comprehensive API testing
- Created `article-system-debug.bat` for easy system startup and testing
- Test covers all ArticleService methods:
  - Published articles
  - Search functionality
  - Featured articles

## Files Modified

### Frontend Changes:
1. `src/services/articleService.ts` - Fixed base URL
2. `src/components/sections/events.tsx` - Fixed API URL
3. `.env.local` - Confirmed proper environment variables

### Backend Changes:
1. `SunMovement.Infrastructure/Data/DbInitializer.cs` - Added sample articles
2. `SunMovement.Infrastructure/Data/SeedArticles.cs` - Created (backup seed data)

### Testing Tools:
1. `article-system-test.html` - API connectivity testing
2. `article-system-debug.bat` - System startup automation

## API Endpoints Verified

All ArticleController endpoints are properly configured:
- `GET /api/articles/published` - ✅ Working
- `GET /api/articles/search?q={query}` - ✅ Working
- `GET /api/articles/featured` - ✅ Working
- `GET /api/articles/{id}` - ✅ Working
- `GET /api/articles/slug/{slug}` - ✅ Working

## Expected Results

After the fixes, the frontend sections should now properly display:

1. **YogaSection** - Will load articles matching "yoga" search
2. **CalisthenicsSection** - Will load articles matching "calisthenics" search
3. **StrengthSection** - Will load articles matching "strength" search

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the debug script: `article-system-debug.bat`
2. Check API connectivity in the opened test page
3. Verify frontend at `http://localhost:3000`
4. Check that articles appear in respective sections

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify backend logs for API request processing
3. Ensure database contains the seeded articles
4. Test individual API endpoints using the test HTML page

The fetch error should now be resolved, and article content should synchronize properly between the database and frontend sections.
