# Product Cache Management Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of cache management for the Products module in Sun Movement, similar to the existing cache management in the Services module.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated ProductsAdminController**
   - Added ICacheService dependency
   - Added ClearCache action method
   - Added cache clearing after CRUD operations

2. **Updated ProductsAdmin Index View**
   - Added Clear Cache button similar to ServicesAdmin view

3. **Enhanced ProductService with Caching**
   - Added cache for GetAllProductsAsync
   - Added cache for GetProductByIdAsync
   - Added cache for GetProductsByCategoryAsync
   - Added cache for GetFeaturedProductsAsync
   - Added cache for SearchProductsAsync
   - Added cache clearing for Create, Update, Delete operations

4. **Added Cache Keys**
   - AllProductsCacheKey = "AllProducts"
   - ProductCategoryPrefix = "ProductCategory_"
   - FeaturedProductsCacheKey = "FeaturedProducts"
   - SearchProductsPrefix = "SearchProducts_"
   - Individual product keys: "Product_{id}"

## How It Works

1. **Cache Retrieval Flow**:
   - First, check if data exists in the cache
   - If not in cache, retrieve from the database
   - Store retrieved data in cache for future requests
   - Return the data

2. **Cache Invalidation Flow**:
   - After creating, updating, or deleting a product
   - After toggling product status (Active, Featured)
   - Manually via "Clear Cache" button in the admin interface

## Testing

Use the test-product-cache.bat script to test the functionality:

1. Run the application with the script
2. Navigate to the Products admin page
3. Test CRUD operations and observe cache behavior
4. Use the Clear Cache button and observe immediate effects

## Benefits

- Reduced database load
- Improved response times for frequently accessed product data
- Consistent cache management across Products and Services modules
- Manual cache clearing option for administrators
