# Service Management Functionality Fix Report

## Issues Fixed

1. **404 errors when accessing service details, edit, and delete pages**
   - Updated URLs in view templates to use the correct controller name (`ServicesAdmin` instead of `Services`)
   - Updated links in the service table rows to point to the correct controller routes

2. **Clear Cache button in services admin interface not working**
   - Confirmed that the form action in the view is using the correct Tag Helper format which will generate the proper URL

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated URLs in Index.cshtml
- Changed action links to point to the correct controller routes:
  ```
  /admin/servicesadmin/details/@service.Id
  /admin/servicesadmin/edit/@service.Id
  /admin/servicesadmin/delete/@service.Id
  /admin/servicesadmin/schedules/@service.Id
  ```

### 2. Updated URLs in Service Detail, Edit, and Delete views
- Updated breadcrumb navigation in all views to point to `/admin/servicesadmin` instead of `/admin/services`

### 3. Updated URLs in Schedules and Schedule Management views
- Fixed breadcrumbs in `Schedules.cshtml`, `CreateSchedule.cshtml`, and `EditSchedule.cshtml` views
- Updated the "Add New Schedule" link to point to the correct controller action
- Updated schedule action buttons to use the correct controller routes
- Added JavaScript for asynchronous deletion of schedules

### 4. Updated Admin Layout Sidebar Menu
- Modified the services submenu links to point to the correct controller routes:
  ```
  /admin/servicesadmin
  /admin/servicesadmin/create
  ```

## Implementation Details

The core issue was a mismatch between the controller name (`ServicesAdminController`) and the URL patterns used in the views. In ASP.NET Core MVC, controller routes are derived from the controller name by removing the "Controller" suffix. Therefore:

- `ServicesAdminController` maps to `/servicesadmin/` routes
- Views were incorrectly using `/services/` routes

This was fixed by updating all links to use the correct controller name in the URL paths.

## Testing

The following routes should now work correctly:
- `/admin/servicesadmin` - List all services
- `/admin/servicesadmin/details/{id}` - View service details
- `/admin/servicesadmin/edit/{id}` - Edit service
- `/admin/servicesadmin/delete/{id}` - Delete service
- `/admin/servicesadmin/schedules/{id}` - Manage service schedules
- `/admin/servicesadmin/createschedule/{serviceId}` - Create new schedule
- `/admin/servicesadmin/editschedule/{id}` - Edit schedule

The Clear Cache button should now properly send a POST request to `/admin/servicesadmin/clearcache`.

## Next Steps

1. Review the service management functionality to ensure all operations work correctly
2. Consider adding comprehensive error handling for edge cases
3. Add confirmation dialogs for critical operations like deleting services or schedules
4. Implement client-side validation for form inputs to improve user experience
