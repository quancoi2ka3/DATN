# User Management System - Completion Report

## Overview
This report documents the successful completion of user management issues in the ASP.NET Core Sun Movement application. All requested features have been implemented and tested.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Staff/Employee Role
**Problem**: User management page showed 3 roles (Admin, Customer, Employee) but create user form only allowed Admin and Customer roles.

**Solution**: 
- Added "Staff" role to `DbInitializer.cs` role seeding
- Updated role array: `string[] roles = { "Admin", "Customer", "Staff" };`
- Verified `UsersAdminController` automatically pulls all roles from database
- All three roles now appear in user creation dropdown

### 2. ✅ Missing Frontend User Registration
**Problem**: No user registration functionality on the frontend (only admin could create users manually).

**Solution**:
- Created `RegisterViewModel` with Vietnamese labels and validation
- Implemented `Register` actions in `AccountController` 
- Created beautiful responsive `Register.cshtml` view with modern UI
- Added password strength indicator and form validation
- Updated `_LoginPartial.cshtml` to include Register link
- Registration creates Customer users by default
- Auto-confirmation implemented for seamless user experience

### 3. ✅ Complete User Management System
**Previously Implemented**:
- Full `UsersAdminController` with CRUD operations
- User locking/unlocking functionality  
- Password reset capabilities
- Role management (assign multiple roles to users)
- Search and filter functionality
- All admin views created with modern Bootstrap UI

### 4. ✅ Database and Role System
**Implemented**:
- Three-role system: Admin, Customer, Staff

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
